Looking in a mirror I note that the lacy upper part of a slip is partly seen in the V-neck of a black shirt I am wearing. Say to myself: \"Why not, everyone knows I am supposed to be a man who wears women's clothes. So what!\" Later I appear to be wearing a skirt with same black shirt and hear someone say that it is afternoon tea time. A woman with a large oven opens the door and I see little cakes inside. She says to be careful, they are hot. I take a brown one that appears to be gingerbread, but I wonder what is inside. While taking it on a paper doily, I note some chocolate balls about 1\" in diameter on a nearby shelf and when the woman turns her back, I take some. Look for a table and all are full. But someone at a table invites me to sit down. I sit and feel good because I remembered to smooth my skirt properly. Later a woman from the institution, some sort of warder, takes 2 or 3 of us on a bus. I sit down alone at an aisle window, conscious of being dressed completely as a woman and with a neatly coiffed hairpiece. I look at arms in the sleeveless dress and observe they are too muscular looking. Some young boys enter the bus and apparently know the warder. They sit in back with her and are all laughing and joking. One is apparently sitting behind me and I feel a rake-like stick poke me under the rear and I jump with a slight protest. Then one of the young boys sits down alongside me. I see he carries a new, coiled bull whip. He turns to me and I note his shirt is open and I poke him away and off the seat with a small stick which I push against his chest. He leaves, saying, \"I'll get you later.\" I hear someone else, one of the girls, jump in indignation and I guess someone has also poked her with the rake stick. Later we are in a bar. I see the warder and the boys and some other people sitting up to the bar. I walk past and sit down at an empty table in what I feel is ladylike fashion, smoothing my skirt. A boy approaches me with a mean look on his face and I begin to realize that the warder has set this whole thing up to allow myself and the other girls to fall into the hands of these bad boys ... and that the bus meeting was prearranged. I am afraid because I do not want to be touched by them or even worse, to be whipped and get hurt seriously. I get up and look for a toilet. Remember saying to someone that I had better use the men's room. Enter and note people staring at me. I enter an open booth, fumble thru dress, slip and corset and finally find my penis. I urinate standing over the bowl and immediately it fills up as my loud, strong and very yellow stream pours down. It flows onto the floor from a bidet which seems strangely connected to the toilet bowl. A janitor walks in and ignores me as he reaches up and pulls a chain.

in the recreation room of some shore resort hotel. Note a young couple seated with knees touching and supporting some sort of game board. I take a chair nearby and watch. On the board are numerous small objects, such as a pin, pencil, piece of chalk and object of game seems to be to place them like dominoes in some sort of order, either from most expensive to least expensive, or vice-versa I leave and walk outside. I see a hotel nearby which is shaped exactly like a large can placed on its side. It's some three or four stories high. I am afraid it might slip any minute and actually roll on down the beach and into the water. It occurs to me that only those lying in the sand sun bathing would be safe, providing that their position coincides with the large rectangular openings of the can-shaped hotel as it rolled over the sand, crushing people.

Also pick up a pair of rubbers in case of tropical rains. I think about supper and note time is 3:15 and decide I must be on my way by 3:30.

I look up at light and there are no colors, then look again and it is green. We continue down the road and then later someone else, a young man in dark purple shirt and matching trousers, is driving us, but the front of the bus inside seems more like a trolley car and he is manipulating the lever as we continue along. He drives up and down the hills and I note they are getting steeper and steeper. Finally in desperation he turns to me as we climb a hill and says he is using all the speed he can get and that we are just about able to make the hill. If they get worse, we won't make it. Ahead I see several grades, but they are small. We reach a plateau and in the distance to the left of the road we see some majestic mountains in the distance. They are misty and the sky is blue and the sun is strong. I realize the rugged mountains are the Rockies and also that I didn't know this southern state was so far to the West. We continue and finally the road ahead narrows until there is only one lane. Our vehicle fills the whole road. Ahead I see that the road swerves, has dangerous turns and then finally unbelievably, it actually turns on its side perpendicular. When I see that, I am furious because the state trooper had not warned us that the road was so bad. I realize we will have to go back and that the tourists will get a refund. I wait at the side of the road as the man in purple shirt walks ahead to see how the road looks.

Exiting from station I note time is 8:45 a.m., but that the weather is foul, dark and murky and uninviting. I think it odd that it should resemble more closely 5:00 a.m. weather. Return to station and get case and then walk to where I have a car waiting, parked opposite station. Astonished to see my car full of people, sort of dark working class types. I place case in with them and find a spot to sit crammed in rear. A cop taps at window and I lower to see what he wants. Asks how come car parked there and I say it was only for a minute while I got my case and that I had brought the car over with me. He seems astonished that I would bring a car with me. (Car is a small blue Renault.) The guy at wheel drives away and when he turns right instead of left, I realize we will not pass the stamp store. I shout to stop and \"get out of my car!\" They continue and ignore me. A few feet later we slow down because many people and some cops are crowded on street. I open window and shout \"Stop!\" and bang my hand on side of car. Car stops as a few police walk over. (Prior to this as we drove away from station I looked around at all other parked cars, thinking I may have actually gotten into wrong car, but I see no other that resembles mine.) I am so annoyed as the cops approach, I cannot think to speak French and keep shouting \"STOP!\" Next we are all in police station and asked to produce registrations. I do and a cop puts into an open, used envelope and does same for the workers' registration and then walks away into another room. The workers, four or five men, a woman and a small child, sit down and wait patiently. I walk up and down, annoyed at all the waste of time, and keep looking at them. They don't seem to bear any malice toward me and I think this odd. A long time passes and the cops don't take any action, and I am worried that maybe I did take the wrong car.
