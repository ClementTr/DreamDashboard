The teacher was Rev. R. of Iowa city but did not look just like him, made me think of Wallin. The room was a long narrow one opening into a church auditorium. Rev. R. said something about collection. I remembered I had none but would look in my coat pocket. Went to coat room. In reaching over folding chairs knocked down some caps, blue and gray angoratams, and found some money, mostly Chinese coppers had fallen out. I picked them up and took them with me as I did not know which wrap they had fallen from. Return to class, sit at side table. Found a short man, dark man by Rev. R. and several pupils. They were drawing up a biographical sketch of Rev. R. Something about an election as to his continuance. He asked if his son could join the class. All said yes. I wondered why a boy in a woman's class. Boy looked pleased and embarrassed. Then we were eating at the same long table. Peculiarly served meal. I asked people near me how to find claimant of my find explaining why I kept the cash. Might I leave it with the dean of women. People around me are changing. Some are from Fargo College. Decide I will advertise in the Iowan.   People are leaving table. I look up and find Rev. R. and others talking but at our end we are through. Excuse self, go to coat room for wraps. Coat room is a suite of three rooms. Tell some girls \"I'll show you why I was late for class but I don't want others to see.\" Three girls laughing spread themselves out as a screen and I show them the money. One girl is B. Wellman. A tiny Chinese girl sees and asks, \"Is it Chinese money?\" I ask \"Did you lose some?\" She says \"no\" but names someone who did. I look for paper to write down my name and address and phone and have him come for money. She says, \"He'll come.\" And then he's there. A rather stout Chinese enters the inner coatroom and gives as his name the one the child gave. He leads me to outer room and we seat ourselves in rockers. There is a woman there who is Chinese but her face is half dark like a Negro's. I ask him how he lost money in a woman's coatroom. He says, \"But she was with me.\" I ask him how much he lost. For a long time can get no answer. Then he says, \"40 coppers.\" I start to count them out for him but there are not that many. Suddenly I realize something is wrong and that he had not really lost that money. Then we are on the street, I coming after him. He throws the money into a basement window grating. Then changes its place and drops its. He tries to extract it but goes on. I come up and try to find it. There are broken dolls in the dirt by the window but it is a business house and at last after I have dug about for a while, I realize it dropped into a room inside but it is noon and I can't get in. I enter waiting room of the building but keep on retreating to corner where I shan't be seen to fix bloomers. When skirt is up a woman is ushered in to wait. I apologize for my condition. Other people enter. A man asks if I will help him invoice that p.m. I say I'll be glad to have work but I've never invoiced before but I's sure I could do it. Then he looks at the woman's papers and tells her to go away until she's 14. I wonder how she can look so old. Then another one waiting tells me to take my turn but I say I've done but I must see the heads. Then father comes in wearing a beard. (He had it cut off some years before his death.) I think I must be seeing wrong for he's dead. It must be his brother, uncle M., but it is father and I ask him, \"How could you come back?\" He says \"Oh, I could\", and kisses me. I say, \"It feels just like you again.\" He laughs, \"Of course.\" We go downstairs to the basement. I see an almost empty room reminding me of the Sunday school room and tell father, \"The day nursery used to be there but we moved it upstairs.\" We go through many rooms. In one room rich people are eating lunch. At last we reach the office near the window behind some junk.

And two little children come running down in horse reins decorated with flowers. I conclude I must be looking at a movie. Yet it still seems to be held in the hand. Scene shifts to long banqueting table. About to eat but have no chair. A number of people begin to hand in chairs. Some mix-up with person next to me about salad but I finally get mine. Then, 4 of us at window to watch boxing. Two people are strangers but the other one with me is someone I know, B.B.? We have folding chairs. First set them at some distance, later close to window. Other two at end of long couch. First act, a very handsome dark-haired boy is to wrestle with another. The two clinch and hit. At last get hold of each other and turn somersaults quickly, in such a way that first one then the other is on back. At last dark-haired boy is down and other in a green stripped suit up. Then the first rising and we see him crying. I think it must be over his defeat. Next act is on a very high scaffold. The boxers are so distant that we can't see well. Friend says to me she wonders why boxing is always on such poor stages. We walk over to field to see better. Quite a crowd. I say \"What a lot we're seeing it for 50 cents.\" \"No, that is the price of the coming play, Snow white and the seven dwarfs.\" We find seats at the end of plank benches near a roped off ring, seats are full. Then some people come on with large cloths, stiff as cardboard, 4 ft. by 6, number of sheets in each hand. Cloths painted in old Egyptian style. While man sing something from bible that I wonder if it isn't sacrilegious about somebody, tearing them in two. Then we can't see well. Things in between my friend and another person go to place to see better. The other one of our party urges me to go too, but I think I can see well enough. Then we start across field. All of a sudden the field is divided into rooms by green curtains. Push past these and look down sort of alley, think I see part of show.

The boat is like a Chinese one. I talk to passengers about boat and decide it's a freight boat. Our steamer has sides that open up. I see a two year old baby standing by open side looking over and rush to seize it and carry it over to other side and ask it to sit with me. A door is swinging in the way of our seats. We go to kitchen. Cook explains some article cooked. See a large oblong tank filled with hot water. Cook hands us things to eat. Nearing destination. Scramble to dress to get off. Must change my white shoes and stockings to darker ones. Change lying face down. See wharf where we are to disembark. It appears crowded. No place for boat to dock. Previously one man left behind and one nearly so jumps on after boat is leaving. R. tells me she has had invitations to walk on shore from every male passenger. She shows me letters to herself and J. which advise her marrying a man even if he is foreign. I see three bridges for an instant. On one is my name in full.
