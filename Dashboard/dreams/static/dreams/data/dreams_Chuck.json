{"children": [{"name": "Chuck", "size": 75, "children": [{"name": "1", "size": 443, "dream": "There are four of us at the beginning and we are among Those on Earth. A spirit, a powerful angel, comes for us and we follow her through the air to a room -- is it in the clouds? The room is long and narrow, and we sit at chairs on the same side of a long, narrow table, looking blankly at the Earth somewhere below us. My chair is the left-most one, and I have a vague feeling of loss, a vague sense that the right-most seat of the four is empty. The angel announces, \"One of us did not make it, and we know what that means.\" I do not completely understand the remark. Something about the angel reminds me of my mother. The angel then flies down to sing for Those on Earth. The scene is a rock concert, where the angel is on a stage with microphones. Her audience on Earth is very large, and we can see all of this from our seats in the long, narrow room. It is night time and the angel sings of the stars. I look at the sky and the stars appear beautifully to me. I want to see the stars more closely, so I get up and leave the long, narrow room, a move I am not sure I should be making. Curiosity is stronger than doubt and I do go back to the Earth. When I arrive I find I am a butterfly skipping across a large meadow near a mountain. One of Those on Earth sees me and touches me. It is very painful: my body, my wings, all feel as if on fire! Even the very sky turns red as I am touched, and I yell out a very loud, \"Ow!\" The person touching me can not hear the yell, and touches me again, apparently trying to catch me as I fly away in hurt. The second touch is just as painful. Altogether I am touched two or three times before escaping. Now I am hiding in the mountains, halfway between Earth and the long, narrow room in the sky. I can not go back to either, and I am now alone. And suddenly I have a great insight: the other from my original group on Earth (the one who did not make it to the right-most seat at the long, narrow table) is a butterfly just like me! The butterflies are the ones who leave boredom looking for beauty. The long, narrow room is a place we must go to when its time has come, but it is also a place we leave when we are ready.", "children": [{"name": "Earth", "size": 8, "children": []}, {"name": "long",

They are loaded, but I am very careful that the trigger on mine is not cocked. There is a security inspection ahead and there is no place to hide the guns. \"I'm getting out of here and doing this again\", I think. I have some kind of power to go back in time a few hours. The terminal turns out to be an airport, and I go back to the time that my plane is about to land. (Somehow I have now lost X.) This time I am the pilot. I land the plane, and without any announcement, run undetected out of the plane through the indoor gate area of the airport. No one sees me yet and I look for a place to dump the pistol, still concealed in my pants pocket. I find a hedge row of bushes inside the terminal, still unblossomed. I conceal the gun there, hoping it will not be seen. I run through all of the hallways of the airport building, with my \"passengers\" still waiting on the plane I just landed. I leave the building and run through the parking lot, hoping that I can finally escape.

Soon I come upon a quarry which is rectangular in shape and perhaps six feet deep. I walk down some steps dug into the ground and look around in the pit. There is a vague awareness of other people in the quarry also looking around. I quickly find some bones lying on the ground, and in the excitement of this discovery, I go running back to the city. I reach a modest ridge just on the outskirts, and get my first clear look at the highly varied architecture of the city, which appears to have grown in my absence. There are buildings in the styles of many ages, and as I leap off the ridge and joyfully bounce from the top of one building to the next, I imagine that I am jumping from century to century.

I find a reference to one of the historical plays (which one?) and open to that page. As we read aloud from there, one of the women in the group suggests, \"We should try it in a real theater.\" Somehow we indeed next find ourselves in a real theater with a live audience. All the members of the original group now have copies of the red-covered \"Collected Works\" to use as scripts, and a few of us, including myself, walk out onto the stage in order to perform from the same page that was read in my home. I begin to read the part named \"King\" opposite one of my woman friends who reads the part of the \"Queen\". There is a hub-bub from the audience and we are not being heard well. Another man (a friend of mine?) is now also trying to read the part of the King. Sensing confusion, I ask him softly, \"Oh, do you want the part? That's fine.\", and I relinquish my role. Seeing that the lines are still being barely heard by the audience, I instruct both he and the Queen, \"In Shakespeare, you have to PROJECT.\" The last word I speak loudly and clearly, and it rings throughout the theater. Murmurs of agreement in the audience follow, and then silence for the first time. I decide that since I no longer have an acting part in the play, I will be the director, and I slip behind a convenient shell on the floor at front center stage. The Queen reads her lines, and then I give a cue to a young girl, maybe eight years old, to read her part, that of a young princess or a magical fairy.

The building is very old, and the pub is reminiscent of Medieval England.  We seat ourselves in a stuffy room at a long rectangular table made of a very sturdy wood and covered by a thin tablecloth. One end of the table is near a stained-glass window which shines colored light in an otherwise dimly lit environment. In the next room is a kitchen where much cooking is occuring. I have a vague notion of pizzas being prepared for our group as we sit around drinking beers from large mugs and making a lot of noise. Since it is a medieval- style establishment, there are certainly no modern inventions, such as television, around. Someone asks, \"Did you bring the TV?

A second fastball goes past me just as quickly as the first; I miss again, but this time my swing is a little better. This happens a few more times, each time my swing improving while still missing the ball. The older brother then brusquely announces, \"0 for 6, time for the next batter.\" The younger brother takes offense at this and urges giving me another chance by saying, \"He's just getting the hang of it.\" A brief argument ensues between the two over whether I should continue batting. Each is disgusted with his brother's position, and they turn their backs toward each other and will not speak. Someone says, \"This is just like their last argument, and they didn't speak to each other for a long time after that.\" Attempting the role of peacemaker, I say to both brothers, \"C'mon.

There is a description of the game and some of the new teams, including a team named the \"Cosmos\", which the magazine article says may follow in a \"tradition of dynasty by previous teams of the same name in earlier leagues.\" I find myself at the opening game playing for the \"Cosmos\". The rules are a bit changed from regular soccer: a center square portion of the field is quite a bit raised in elevation over the rest (i.e., it is not a level playing field.) This center portion is landscaped with bushes and trees, and the rest of the field, which looks like a standard field, is reached by steep ramps. Play begins at the center of the square section. The ball makes its way towards the goal of the opponents of the \"Cosmos\". I am standing there, and when the ball is nearby I kick it to the goal. I watch almost as if in slow-motion as the opponents' goal-keeper misses. I have scored a goal and everyone in the crowd cheers! Play resumes. I see that several players use their hands in this version of soccer, but I am not sure when this is allowed, so I decide to play as if it were regular soccer. Again I am standing near the opposing goal as the ball comes. I break out of a pack of players to get to the ball and from the right wing position I kick it into the goal. The poor opposing goalkeeper looks overwhelmed as the score goes by him. In an apparently new rule, after the goal is scored the goalkeeper himself kicks out the ball into play (instead of starting at the center of the field.) The opposing team plays sloppily and I quickly get possession of the ball again. I boot it hard directly at the goal and score a third time. The crowd goes wild as I exclaim, \"I LOVE this game!\" I turn to my brother X., who is one of my \"Cosmos\" teammates, and confide to him, \"Their goalie is not too good; they should get another one.\"", "children": [{"name": "goal", "size": 7, "children": []}, {"name": "ball", "size": 6, "children": []}, {"name": "field", "size": 5, "children": []}, {"name": "Cosmos", "size": 4, "children":

When I get off the elevator, I find myself alone at Cairo Airport. In marked contrast to its Israeli counterpart, this airport is quiet, relaxed and almost empty. I find myself lying down outdoors on a patch of grass near a runway. The sun shines brightly and the airfield is surrounded by lush green trees. As I lazily look up from my siesta, I spot a small, single-passenger pedal-powered airplane hovering overhead. The pilot spins his craft, then stops it in mid-air, as he pedals what looks like a black flywheel with bicycle pedals attached. Then he releases the flywheel and glides away. The flywheel falls quickly and strikes a young man lying on the ground close to me. He does not appear to be hurt, but he is clearly annoyed. There is a young woman lying at his side who says of the pilot, \"What an idiot!\" Then the two of them look at each other and she hugs him around the waist. I get up and walk towards a nearby building. On the way a large group of teenagers passes in the opposite direction. At first I see a few boys and a few girls and do not note anything unusual. Then I see a boy walk by wearing a tank-top shirt which exposes his highly muscular arms. Soon another boy with a similar shirt walks by; he, too, has highly muscular arms.
