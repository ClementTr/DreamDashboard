The parents and grandparents were there, and me too. Of course, in real life we couldn't all be sitting on the porch, but in my dream they were. Suddenly I wasn't on the porch any more, but was talking to Mary B. over the phone. While I was talking to her, her little 4-year-old brother got on the line and said they had ice cream at his house and he'd like me to come over to his house and have some. (This is very common, not at all uncommon.) So I went over there. Next thing I knew Mary asked me to stay all night (which is another common occurrence). All of a sudden the third floor of her house was a huge, big attic, no partitions -- a huge ballroom attic. I didn't see it myself, but I knew it was up there. (Evidently I had seen one before in my history.) Up in this attic was living a professor from Case, a very fanatic type. I had never met him. He was living up in this attic with three daughters and his wife. One of his daughters was named Lucinda and the B's were terrified of him, but yet he lived up there. It seemed that I stayed over at B's for quite a few nights. Every morning this professor would tramp his kids down the stairs to the second floor and send them to three pianos which were lined up along the walls. Each morning he would run these children down there, and say they had to practice all day long and they would very obediently do it. For quite a few days Mary and I didn't pay any attention to him, but one morning he cornered us and said he was going to beat us up because of our morals. Mary and I ran screaming down the stairs to the first floor and hid behind the stairs. He came running after us and for about four days. He was searching for us all over town and all this time we stayed crouched behind the stairs -- didn't go out to eat or go to the bathroom or anything. Finally one day he saw a coat moving behind the stairs so he grabbed Mary by the ankle, pulled her out and took her upstairs with him. I wasn't going to let Mary suffer alone, so I came out and went upstairs after him because if she was going to suffer, I was going to suffer too. I went running all over the upstairs, opening the doors and yelling, \"Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary!\" Then suddenly from downstairs Mary called up to me and said, \"What's the matter, Sally?

So Faye said she would go and asked me to go along to keep her company. I said sure I would. Faye told me that we were going to fly out and the trip would cost $1000.00 and we were going to live there a month. So I asked my parents if I could go and if I could have a thousand dollars, and they said sure, for me to have a trip to the Rocky Mountains it was worth it. Linda said she would go a little ways with us and then she would get off and come back. So we started out and we were in the plane and some fellow on the plane gave me a present. It was a compact with a combination of rouge, lipstick, powder and cold cream all in the compact. We were going up a great big mountain and it was raining, and we got to the top of this real high mountain and the pilot said he had a terrible feeling this was going to be his last flight. He had flown 35 years, but this was the end. And Faye said, \"Oh dear, I believe in hunches. We have got to get off this plane.\" So we decided we would get off at the next landing and look for another plane. And I was going to call my mother and see if it would be all right with her, so I called her from the plane. And she said sure, she wouldn't care if I had to get on a plane that was going to Tokyo first and then coming back to the Rocky Mountains, just as long as I would be safe.

So I decided to call R. at his hotel and tell him. Somehow I knew his room number and so I called up and asked for his room, and come to find out, the operator was Mr. F. and he asked who I was and I gave him my name. He said, \"You can't talk to him.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"Because I know that you like him and the prestige of our Studio can't allow that kind of relationship between student and teacher. Anyway you have just got to cut out feeling that way. I am going to talk to you and your mother about it when you come this Saturday, and I am also going to talk to Mr. R. about it.\" And I hung up. I was immensely disturbed. I didn't want R. to find out how I felt. I was sort of half anxious and half afraid. So I told my mother about it and she agreed with me completely and she felt it was a completely stupid way to act. She didn't feel it was a bit called for or justified. In the next scene I was over at your house and I was telling you and K. about it. And I was in your house sitting on the davenport, and at the same time I was talking over the phone to K. and she was behind the davenport. And you were there too, sitting in the chair. She asked me what I was going to do about it and I said, \"Well, I was just going to go down there and act real breezy about it, just like nothing had happened. And if they told me I had to have somebody else to dance with me, I was going to act real indifferent like, real nonchalant. The next scene, Mother and I were entering the reception room in the Studio and Mr. R. was there and greeted me real friendly like he always does, real sweet. And we went off to the Studio. We pushed one of the knobs for the record to start and while we were waiting for the record to start, we went over to a table that was up against the wall, at one end of the Studio. The top was covered by a white chiffon tablecloth, very voluminous. It was a gorgeous thing, very soft and full and beautiful. And on the table were two big silver candelabras with candles in them, and I think they were lit. Neither R. nor I were content with the way the table cloth was arranged, so while we waited for the music to come on, we went over to the table cloth to rearrange it in nicer folds. Then we started dancing the rumba. We did good and we had a lot of fun together, laughing and talking. And just then the door opened and in came Mr. F. and my mother and a whole bunch of men. And Mr. F. said, \"Come here, R., I want to talk to you a minute.\" And Mother and I started dancing the rumba. And I said to Mother, \"I don't like the way you lead this. Here, I am going to show you how.\" (By the way, she had a suit on.) As we were dancing, someone came up behind me and grabbed me from behind with both arms around the middle part of my legs, just below the knees. The hands were locked. And this person pulled me down on the floor and it was Mr. R. And I had on those panties that have tight elastic legs, and he pulled up my dress and pulled up one pant leg and just as that happened, I felt the hot light of flashbulbs and come to find out, all these men were photographers. And just as they did that, I gave a kick and said, \"Let me go!\" And so I got up and went into the reception room with my mother. Mr. F. was there and he said that \"Mr. R. accepted a big boost in salary to do that to you, so you couldn't like him and so the prestige of our Studio would not be ruined.\" (These photographers were witnesses like.) And I was very hurt and it hurt me more than anything to think he would accept payment for such a thing, that he was that low. It wasn't only the idea that he would do such a thing, but that he would accept payment for it. I felt like crying, but I didn't.

We were driving along and all of a sudden we stopped and there was a big woods next to us and it was on fire. Daddy and the other couple got out and started fighting the fire. All of a sudden, I got afraid that the car would catch on fire so I kept telling my mother, \"Come on, get out, get out, get out!\" She was very calm and very serene, like she always is. So I got out and I began to smell the smell of gas and I knew the car was beginning to catch on fire and I woke up. Q: Did you notice any other sensory effects about the fire besides that of smell? A: No. Q: Have you ever been in or to a fire? A: No, just bonfires. Q: Haven't you noticed how noisy a fire can be? A: Oh yes. Well, I didn't hear the fire in my dreams. I wasn't that close. Q: Then why did you fear that the car would catch fire? A: I don't know. Q: Did you notice that everybody got out of the car but your mother and when you woke up, she was still in the car? A: Well, but I told her to get out and she wouldn't; she just sat there, calm and serene. Q: Were you \"burned up\" at your mother that day? A: Well, the only thing I can think of at all is that she told me to be cautious and I don't like her telling me to be careful, and I did blow up about that. I told her what I thought and where to go. In this case I resented it because I was enjoying myself. At least you should enjoy yourself while you can.

We were all in rocking chairs, but then you and K. faded and it was Mary and A. And I was over there, I think, for lunch and their grandmother came into the room and said, \"Here, I would like to give you this.\" In my right hand I had a stylus and just before she gave me these things, it changed into a cigarette, and I had an ashtray in my hand too. I had to lay them down to receive these things. In my left hand she gave me the most gorgeous orchid I have ever seen. It was mounted on a great big, huge cellophane thing like a doily; it had a twisted stem and the top was all fluted, and placed in the center of this was this big orchid. In my right hand she gave me a thing like a floor lamp, only there was no base, but it had the pole, and underneath the shade instead of a lamp bulb, it was all flowers. I smelled both of these and I was very disappointed because they didn't smell (of course, orchids don't). And then I got ready to leave. I was going to some house on Melbourne. I started out by myself and I was going down the street carrying both of these, the orchid in my left hand and the thing in my right hand. The sidewalk was very rough. I didn't know quite where the house was, and I was kind of concerned about it. I came to Phillips and stopped to wait for the cars to stop. All of a sudden, Carol said, \"Oh, here you are. I have been waiting for you.\" And I said, \"I was going to your house.\" And she said, \"Well, good.
