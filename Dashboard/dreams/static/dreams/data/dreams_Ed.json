As I am drinking, something (a presence?) begins shaking me. My entire body shakes from my head to my toes -- at first gently, but soon, more violently. When the shaking starts, I am surprised, and initially not frightened. I think I call out, \"Is that you, Mary?\" But when the shaking becomes more violent, I become very frightened. I know this is not Mary, but some terrifying and evil force. I must break away from this powerful grip. I think, if only I can escape its hold on me and scream, this will get Adam's attention and I'll be safe -- or saved. I don't know how I do it, but somehow I break from the grip of this force. Then, slowly, I back out of the bathroom, and out of the bedroom and into the hall. All this while I keep my eyes focused in the direction of where I think the evil force is located.

I don't think that is much money for them, but I don't object. If she wants to sell them at that price, it's OK with me. Before I can go to the garage, I have to go to the bathroom. I look down the hall in the direction of the bathroom and see a woman seated on the toilet. The bathroom door is open, but the woman's face is somewhat hidden. Then I think I catch a glimpse of her face.

Adam appears to be about 6 or 7 years old, when I see him more clearly, later in the dream. Immediately after Maria tells me that we are going to meet Mary, I start a frantic search of the building. I race from room to room. I am looking for something, but don't know what it is I seek. Many questions are running through my mind. \"If Mary is dead, how can she come back?\" \"If she isn't dead, where has she been?\" \"How do I explain to Mary my marriage to Bonnie?\" But no matter what questions come to my mind, I am excited and looking forward joyfully to seeing Mary. Suddenly we are all sitting around the dining room table, including Mary. This is where I have a good chance to see her at close range. She looks terrific. She is just a wee bit pale, but otherwise she is as she had been in 1959, before the second recurrence of the illness. Mary tells us that she had been through numerous operations in order to be restored to good health. All that surgery had been pretty rough on her, but, thank goodness, it's all over except for one more operation. She describes the nature and purpose of the pending operation. The name of the operation is a long one. Either I forget the name, or can't pronounce it. Mary assures us this is a minor operation compared to all the others she's had. And when it'll be done, she'll be OK again. We then realize that we shouldn't be sitting around the table. We're supposed to be in my car.

I ask her to leave. When I tell her about sending the woman home, Mary points out that that woman is the wife of our paperhanger. I don't know whether we laughed at this, but we certainly did not take it seriously. I can't see Mary clearly, but I know it is she. We are young -- in our mid or late 20's. In another dream scene, Mary calls us to dinner. I see two children who appear to be 4 or 5 years old. I assume they are ours, but neither is Maria, Robert or Adam.

He has just opened a can of salmon and broken an egg into a soup bowl. I explain to him that it is important that I be able to use the kitchen in order to make supper for Mary. He is reluctant to leave. But another man comes in and explains my situation to him. The first man graciously agrees to leave, telling me I may use the food that he had started to prepare for his own supper. For some reason, both men appear to me to be Russian. Mary arrives home. She has short hair and is wearing a gray suit. We greet each other with spontaneous hugs. I notice that she is in pain and ask her what is the matter. She tells me that she has an infection, but she's been to the doctor and will be OK. I ask Mary if she'd like supper and suggest she lie down while I prepare it.

I do not see Mary throughout this dream, but I do know that I am with Mary when we came to dine in this restaurant. The dream begins just after Mary has excused herself to go to the washroom. After a long wait for her return, I am worried. I call the Manager of the hotel and ask him to help me find Mary. We are in a nonsmoking section of the restaurant. Some men take a table close to ours and all of them light up cigars or cigarettes and the smell is terrible. The Manager, who is very kind, goes over to those men and gives them a severe tongue lashing. I am very embarrassed. Then he seats us at another table. I have the impression that Maria and Adam are also in the hotel, but I'm not worried about them. I suggest to the Manager that he send a female staff person into the ladies' washroom to search for Mary. He thinks that's an excellent idea, and also suggests that we look elsewhere for her by ourselves. The manager then leads me on a long search for Mary. We go through a tunnel under the hotel and out into the street. He leads me to an address where he was sure we will find Mary. But when we get to this address, I discover that it is a small ladies' wear store. It is managed by 2 or 3 older women. They know nothing of Mary's whereabouts and are quite cool and indifferent to our inquiries. They just want us to leave them alone and go away. So we start to search again for Mary. The dream ends here. During our walk through the tunnel, somehow I received a phone call, or communication, from a woman (who is not Mary). She may be the woman sent by the manager to look for Mary in the ladies' washroom. Perhaps she is reporting to me on what she found. This woman is laughing and joking and I am amused.

I believe that our lack of frequent sex is her fault. While I have a great deal I want to say to her about this, I just can't get anything out of my mouth. I want to ask her why she always falls asleep ion the sofa, night after night. This prevents me from having sex if she's not beside me in bed. I also wanted to remind her of how very emphatic she was about not wanting sex when we had vacationed in the Bahamas. I'll never forget her comment: \"Ed, I didn't come on holiday to have sex.\" I also wanted to remind her that she is ill and having sex is next to impossible. But somehow I am not able to say any of these things. I seem to be babbling. All I can do is plead with her to stay with me. I insist that I do love her.

There are no doors or windows, so we can't find the entrance to the movie house. We wander around the outside looking for an entranceway.

In the first scene, Mary and I and two other people are sitting at a picnic table, just to the south side of the Sunnyside Boardwalk. We can see the lake in the near distance on our left side. It is dusk. Mary is happy and talking animatedly. I cannot see her face, only the back of her. Although in the dream I am sitting to the immediate left of Mary, \"I\" am also behind Mary, and myself, and those other 2 people, viewing everything from that angle. Mary is full of fun, laughing and joking. Two sailors are walking along the Boardwalk, coming toward us. Suddenly, Mary laughs, pulls off her jersey and bra, and \"flashes\" her bare breasts at the sailors. I quickly drape Mary to hide her breasts. The sailors don't appear to have noticed Mary's action, and continue their walk along the Boardwalk, still moving toward us. For some reason I'm afraid that the sailors may attack us. So with one arm around Mary and with the other arm free, I look about for a weapon or some means of protection of defense. I see on the picnic table objects that look like large platters made of a strong, shell-like material. I take hold of one of them with my free hand, intending to use it aggressively should the sailors attack us. They don't. They continue their walk and pass us by. In the second scene Mary and I are walking along what appears to be a country lane, or a poorly maintained, narrow street in the poorer part of a town. Mary is on my right side, and we are holding hands. As in scene 1, \"I\" am behind Mary and myself, watching the couple stroll down that lane/ street. They are sad and are crying. I am reminiscing on my life. I say that I'm only 22 years old and have already had a very hard life. Then I realize that Mary has had a much harder life than I. I turn to her and ask her to talk about her hardships. I am not sure whether I'm 22 or 71 years of age, but I make calculations in my mind and somehow arrive at the number \"22.\" I remember saying something like, \"Life is a long, or a short, ride with very few stops for fun and pleasure.

I didn't want to, but he persuaded me to do so. Somehow Mary gets into this situation, because she wants to come along. The reason Jerry wants me to take him is because I have a car and he doesn't. I drive to an ugly, barn-like structure. As soon as we enter this building, Mary and Jerry disappear. They go through a doorway directly opposite the door we use to enter the building. I follow them through the same door, but can't find them. There are no other people inside this building. I want to find someone who might help me find Mary and Jerry, but there is no one to be found. Since I can't find anyone to help me, I decide to go outside and wait for them. I am bored because I have nothing to do, and angry at Mary and Jerry for deserting me. When I get outside, I notice an empty lot next to the Vaudeville building from which I had just emerged. There is a huge pile of sand on this vacant lot. I decide to investigate, go over to the lot, and walk onto the sand pile. When I do so, the sand caves in under me, and I begin to sink. I'm terrified. I call aloud for help. I see many, many people in front of the Vaudeville theater. None are looking in my direction, except one man. He is looking directly at me. I call out to him, telling him I'm in serious trouble. I desperately plead with him to pull me out of the sand. I see myself sinking deeper into this quagmire. But that man just looks at me, does not acknowledge my plea for help. He doesn't answer me. He does nothing. The scene changes. I am at home with Mary and we are in the kitchen. I debate with myself whether or not to talk to her about what had happened earlier -- about my anger at her and Jerry for deserting me -- about my fall into the sand. I think I hesitated to talk to Mary about these things because I know she isn't well. But finally I decide to discuss this with her.

I am disappointed that we will not continue lovemaking but respect her decision to stop.", "children": [{"name": "Mary", "size": 3, "children": []}, {"name": "bed", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "stop", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "disappointed", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "continue", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "decision", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "standing", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "respect", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "kiss", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "bend", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "respond", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "tightly", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "effect", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "embrace", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "lips", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "foot", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "words", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "disengage", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "lovemaking", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "wed", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "wet", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "agree", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "comfortable", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "Im", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "passionate", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "bedroom", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "begins", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "suggests", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "undress", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "kissing", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "French", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "suddenly", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "hold", "size": 1, "children": []}], "polarite": -1}, {"name": "143", "size": 176, "dream": "I'm in the bathroom making up a \"welcome home\" greeting card on a towel.

I rush over and greet her just as she gets to the top of the stairs. I gather her in my arms and hug her. She looks fine, and except for her heavy breathing from climbing the stairs, she is OK.
