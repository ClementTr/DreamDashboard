And so I was wandering around the halls of this really big building looking for a phone and I think I remember going back into the doctor's office and calling D, my husband, but he was staying with his brother and his mother and I guess because his van broke or something and that he had gone to bed and I so I was wandering around this building, and all of a sudden I was with somebody. And they kept changing who they were and they changed from my best friend in grade school through high school to my best friend from high school through college, and my best friend now, and they kept switching from one person to the other and we were going all around this building and somehow we ended up in my old church, outside the sanctuary and I started to go down the stairs to the lower hall of the church and I said to my friend \"I've got to find a phone, I wish I could find a phone\" and the church was lit, like it always was when I could see, but it was late like it looked at night. Then she called me and said \"there's a phone right here\". And so I went back up the stairs, but I felt kind of scared or anxious about going back, and then I got to the phone and found that I didn't know how to use it, I finally figured out how to use it and began to dial it and I dialed 4-6 and then I realized I was dialing my parent's old phone number and that they didn't live there anymore, and they were really far away and they couldn't help me anymore and I hung up and I started to cry and I said to my friend, \"nobody can help me, nobody can help me I don't belong here\" and I went down this back hall which used to belong to the nursery school that was held at our church, and I was crawling down the hall and I came up to this room and I was still crawling, and I went in but it was my next door neighbor's play room from when I was little. I was crawling across the play room and I was, there were toys everywhere, like on, all over the floor like there always were there, but I wanted to get up on the couch for some reason, it looked kind of like mid-afternoon in the playroom, I think there was something else, in the playroom, like some other scene which I'm not remembering... Then my friend came back in later and I crawled back over to her and I curled up against her and I was crying \"I want to go home, I want to go home\" and she wasn't saying anything, but I thought

I pulled the phone away from my ear and thought that it might be a bad thing to listen or by listening something bad would occur. I went back out to the kitchen which was small and dark and confining. Like it was paneled with some kind of dark wood. And her 2 kids were there, in there 20's and they kept looking at me like I was something really strange and they wouldn't talk to me so I went back to the bedroom, feeling stupid for not packing anything. And suddenly there was my family, having a party in the kitchen, where I was hiding away from. This guy from a soap opera I watch, showed up and he like picked me up and put me on the bed and pinned me down and I wasn't scared, he didn't do it in a hostile way.

I felt completely attractive and as though I fully deserved the affections of this young man, who's name I do not know. We went many places together and did many things together. He would hold my hand whenever we were walking, and if we were in a room, he would involuntarily hold me in his arms and caress me, my hair, and kiss me but very dispassionately. There were no sexual implications at all. In this particular part of the dream I was getting dressed to go out with him somewhere and he came into the room while I was getting dressed and I said \"don't come in, I'm getting dressed\" and he came in and said that we were going to go to this house on the outskirts of town, and I said \"all right, I'll be ready in just a few minutes\" and he left and my son came in and talked to me about something and whatever it was didn't make much sense and he left, and the strange thing was that my son was his age, 39, but I was still the \"younger woman\". Eventually I got dressed. I had showered and done all the feminine things, the deodorant, the cologne and so forth and met the young man and walked hand in hand for quite a distance, to a beautiful street where there were all theses old sea captains houses, like we have on the coast of Maine. The street was lined with these houses on both sides of the street and we walked by many of them and finally came to one that was more like a southern plantation with the pillars in the front supporting a balcony. And we went around to the side of this house and we entered a door and climbed a flight of stairs and there was a door at the top and he had a key which unlocked the door, and we walked into a room with very high ceiling, no carpet on the floor, but an ugly brown chair, and an ugly blue chair... I don't remember any draperies, and there was a big old television set in one corner, obviously an old, black and white and he led me through a door into another room, which was totally unfurnished, it was quite a maze of rooms actually, all empty of furnishings except that first one. There was pealing paint on the walls which I believe were painted white, but that's not very vivid now, and he left me to go somewhere and a friend of his came in and asked me how I like the apartment and I said that it could be very nice if it was fixed up and a couple, a man and a woman, presumably his wife, and a little boy came in and walked into another room, which I assumed was a bedroom, they were very, very tired, and they put the boy to bed in another small bedroom, and they disappeared and I can't describe them to you, and I stood in a hall and leaned up against a wall, and I was very nicely dressed, I had on black panty hose, and nice black shoes, a dark gray skirt with a black sweater, some earrings and I felt as though I looked very nice. And across from this hallway there was good-sized hole in the wall, 6 or 8 inches in diameter and down the floor came a good sized spider, and I am deathly afraid of spiders, and I just cringed up against this wall and shouted to this friend of my friend to please come and kill this spider and he said \"get real, I don't like them, I'm afraid of spiders too\". So he didn't come to help me and the spider just came closer on the opposite side and he tried his best to dig his way in under the wall. He couldn't, and he only had 4 legs. And he had an oval, red patch on his back, but when he climbed the wall to get up to this hole, it turned to be gray and fuzzy. And when it looked in this hole and then tilted down, clinging to the rim of this hole with his back legs, and when he lurched up and he had a very small mouse in it's 2 front legs and he tipped the mouse up and opened his mouth and the blood ran out of the mouse's mouth and into his.

It had a glass front and was perhaps 3 feet long and perhaps a foot deep. And there were things inside it which I had to get. On the left side there was a bright yellow something which I had to reach inside and get but curled near it was a huge reptile of some sort. Probably a circumference of 20 inches at least around his middle, very, very frightening and I drew my hand back and when I did, it startled him and he came out of the cage it did not have a grid over it.

Then the dream jumps to my old house that I grew up in and J was there too and my parents and my sister and I and my friend N. N was my first roommate when I got my apartment and N had a long antennae from a radio and we're getting stations, faraway stations, but when you walk past you have to make sure you don't walk into the antennae. So she's getting a faraway station and she's wanting me to listen to it, but I wanted to go to bed, but she persuaded me to listen to this funny show, there was a song on the radio and I was listening to it and they had different beat in music to it, so we were laughing about the song. And when I decided that we would go into the living room, J was there and she was going to watch TV with my parents, M and my sister, but I was torn between watching TV with them or because I was tired, going to bed. So I said \"goodnight\" and they all sat down on different couches and chairs and I saw that they were all settled in and I gave it a little bit of thought and, this is about 9:30 at night, I remember seeing the light was on in the living room and I remember the TV was on, I could hear the TV, I could hear them all taking their positions and after a bit more thought I said that I was going to bed because I was tired and I went back to my old room, where I used to sleep and I saw J's pajamas and I moved them, put them somewhere else, I don't remember where. Then I took my guide dog in my room, and for a minute I couldn't remember if I had taken her out at 9:00. Then I remembered that they were doing some kind of construction work in the back yard and I was wondering if it was okay to go out there and I could hear bulldozers and stuff. Then I remembered that I had taken her out but I also thought that if I hadn't I would have taken her out in the front yard. The back wasn't such a good idea because they were doing some kind of digging.

And you could feel the recess of the rectangle on one side and I said \"oh, I've never had one of these before\" and I ate it and it was good.

There must have bee 45 students all standing around asking questions and nobody was assisting them, and I wasn't there to get a guide dog, but I remember thinking, gee, what a disorganized school, to have these people standing around asking questions and not being seated in a room, being talked to about what to expect and what its going to be like. And then we were in this other place and it was really early in the morning and we had eaten breakfast and I was walking around and there was a lot of grass and a lot of opened space, and for some

Where she was living in the dream was not her real house, it seemed that her house was a good sized house and for some reason my son and I had to walk home. We were in a very small entryway, I knew that I was going to be carrying something as we walked home. I don't know what it was but I knew it was going to be cumbersome and so would interfere with easy walking. I considered taking a bus. Anyway, my son, knowing that we were going to have to walk home, or because I had led him to believe so, he walked out the door and it was raining so I brought him back inside because I realized he was in his stocking feet. I bent down to help him find and put on his shoes and I felt that his little socks were wet naturally because he had stepped on wet ground. Then the scene changed again and however we got back here, we were back in our own apartment and there was someone here to visit and she was sitting on my son's bed.

I had a feeling this was a gang related thing. I had no clue; what we were supposed to have done, what they thought we had done, but he had placed 2 high stools, like the ones at my breakfast bar, up against a brick wall. Lindsy was already seated on hers, I was still standing, being given my instructions by this creep, who had handed us each, I don't know if these were packages of juice, made of a type of heavy duty foil paper, very good for like taking to a beach or something,. She already had hers and I was being handed mine, and hearing the instructions, however these 2 bags were filled with oil. We were being instructed to sit on these stools and drink this oil. I could hear Lindsy, it was terrible, out of fear or absolute obedience, was drinking this stuff down like a glass of water if you were thirsty. I could hear her swallowing and I remember thinking \"I can't drink this poison, its going to make me very sick.\" Right after I heard her drinking, I heard this extremely violent vomiting, it was Lindsy, which then induced my own. I had raised mine to my lips but I never did take a drink of it. Thank goodness, the scene changed and I was in the same building, but in a higher level of it and I was in what felt like a very large, comfortable apartment that was mine. It was my living quarters. A neighbor had come over from across the hall telling me there was something on TV which I might enjoy watching and I said, \"Yes, that I would, thank you, I'll watch it on my own.\" He became a little bit offended and wanted to know why and I said \"Because if I want to get up and fix myself a cup of coffee or something, I could.\" The scene changed one more time and I was walking down, the same building, I left my apartment evidently, I was walking down a rather long corridor, and I was being careful, I was being careful because I didn't know what obstacles might be in the way. I reached the end of it and I went through a door and was on the outside of the building. Oddly, outside of the building, I felt counter tops that had cabinets underneath just like you would have in a kitchen, and I was opening them up to investigate, I found there were some dishes, some of which were perfectly empty.
