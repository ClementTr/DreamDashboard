I was sitting there thinking how difficult it was and I was scared up there and then my wife was beside me and she said that my twin brother T was down at the bottom, in tears, he was lying down, he just couldn't make it and he was upset and it was just too much for him, and my cousin came up, just walked right up and was having a good time and was talking to us and we told him, we admitted it was just too much for us and he apologized and said he was really sorry and that he just hadn't realized. Then, I remember I had a big 2 liter pop bottle and I was telling my wife some sort of story, explaining to her how much the bottle cost... \"it was $1.29\" or something like that and here's what happened to it I just threw it off the mountain and it went crashing down to the bottom somewhere. Then we talked for a while. Then there was someone else there, I don't know who it was, but when we were talking about how difficult it was he said, \"well I believe in giving it the old Marine try, that means you ask God for help 101 times and usually that works.\" I was thinking about that. Then we decided to go back down and in going back down, I found that there was a paved way that we could make it, very easily, it was just like a steep slope going down, like a sidewalk. So we went back down, and we were in a house and my cousin was still there and I found this old knife that I wanted to have sharpened. And the blade was split at the tip so it had 2 points, like a fork almost, it was split right in the middle and my cousin showed me, he said \"come right on down this other little slope to this ledge\", this was still in the house though. He had somehow used the computer to create a vibration so that when I took this knife and held it against the flat surface of the cement, it was vibrating like crazy, and I was able to sharpen the blade by holding it for quite a long while, like 5 minutes on each side, flipping it over, feeling the edge to make sure it was getting sharp and then E, my wife, was lying down right next to us on the couch, trying to sleep and she began to complain about the noise it was making and how it would wake up the neighbors and she said \"you know how these people around here swear!\" And I said \"I don't care, its not making that much noise and they were going to have to put up with it or I might just have to stab somebody! Once I had this thing sharpened\" And we all had a good laugh at that. I remember thinking that I've got to get my cousin to explain to me how he did that, how he was able top do that with the computers, setting up that field that would make this knife vibrate.",

My brother called me back and said \"come on, you've got to come back this other way. There was a shed there, a really small, wooden house of a thing, and I could get into it but there was no opening to get out of the other side to get out. He kept calling me and saying \"you've got to come through here, this is the only way to get through here to get back.\" I said \"Well, I didn't have to come through here going down, why do I have to go through here going back?\" and he said, \"well, you just have to. Its too far to go around it.\" He insisted that I try to get out of this thing and the wood in it was all old and rotted, so I started ripping pieces of it off, until I made room for me to get out. And I kept tearing at it and finally managed to make a space big enough for me to crawl out and drop down to the ground on the other side if it. I felt really guilty about it, thinking \"boy, I'm really tearing this place up\" and I asked my brother if he thought anybody saw me and he said \"yeah! A lot of people did.\" And I asked him what that shed was for and he said \"That's where they do people's taxes.\" And I felt bad about this and I thought I should really find out who owns this and pay them for ripping it up even though it was in bad shape. Then we were on a bicycle and we were going really fast along these roads, I was riding on the back of it, leaning back on what I remember used to be called a sissy bar. My brother was peddling and we were going so fast it was almost as if we were on a motorcycle. It was a bike though, it was so quiet and he just seemed to be peddling it effortlessly. I remember saying to him \"Let's stop at Butler's store on the way home and get something to drink, like a pop or something.\" The next thing I knew we were in some doctor's office and it had something to do with taxes but they were doing a kind of cursory examination of people and there was a couple across from us we were talking to. A woman came out of the inner office and called me instead of my brother but it was my brother that was supposed to be examined.

The next thing I remember I was out in my backyard sitting at a picnic table eating dinner with my mother and some other people. My mother was sitting right to my right. I don't remember what we were eating, but the yard was kind of sloped down and we were back towards the end of it and we were sitting there eating and talking. I mentioned to my mother that I had had a shot and said \"I bet I could probably drink beer now and I bet I could have a few now.\" [Reality, I have been a recovering and sober alcoholic for 14 years] And my mother said \"Oh, I don't know what I would do if I started to find beer bottles and found out that you were drinking again.\" I started to laugh and said \"well, you know there have been a number of times when I've had a few! It doesn't really bother me if I just drink beer and don't drink too much.\" She didn't sound too believing but said \"oh, that's interesting.\" My thoughts and been that maybe if this shot for marijuana was effective, it might allow me to drink like a regular drinker without having any bad effects from it. My mother left. They had all left and gone somewhere. I was by myself, and I thought I had better start cleaning up the dishes and I picked up my plate and I had a glass which I left there, and started to walk. I heard a splash and realized that I was right along side of a river and I didn't want to fall in the river, and I couldn't exactly remember which way I had to go to get up to my house. I was pretty sure I could feel that the land sloped a little bit, and I thought I was okay and so I started to walk in generally the right direction, but I sort of veered off to the side of my yard and got tangled up in some bushes that are there. I kept walking and at one point I brushed against a wire antenna that I have in my back yard in reality and I remember thinking \"boy this thing is really hanging too low. I should get a pole to prop up the middle with\" I kept walking and got myself straightened out and got up to the top near my house, where a patio is and a dishwasher was there, and I started to put my plate inside the dishwasher, and I was going to go back and get some more when I started to hear all these voices from inside my basement. It was my neighbor E from across the street, with a bunch of people and they were talking, it was as if she was giving them a tour of my house. Then she came out and started thanking me and then my mother came out and she thanked us both for being such nice people and being such good help.

So I began to unpack the box he gave me, and there did appear to be an Opticon and had a little hand held camera with it. A little box that had something similar to a little Braille display, maybe a one line Braille display, maybe an Opticon. I started taking out this thing and all the accessories that came with it and I was amazed at the different plugs and cords and there were adapters like standard serial port adapters for computers, there were some that were offset between the male and female end of it. There were some wires with like plastic keys hanging off of them. My co-worker, M happened to be there then and she said \"Oh, this is interesting, you could probably stick this in a car's ignition to start it if you happened to lose your key.\" We had a laugh about that. I just kept looking at these different pieces. There was one piece that I fitted onto the back of the machine with a little flange, it was some sort of little plug. Throughout the dream everything seemed pretty familiar to me and I seemed to know what everything was for.

Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked \"How bad does it look?\" and she said \"Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze.\" Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down \"What are you doing here? Get out of here now!\" And I responded \"I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this.\" I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad.

I was feeling all the different coats, even reached into the pocket of one of them which felt similar to mine, and I found a bunch of balled up papers and different things and I realized that it wasn't my coat. I had to go through the whole coat rack one coat after another until I found mine. They all seemed to feel the same and I had a cab waiting for me so I was really in a hurry to go. I finally did find it, it was way over on the right hand end of the coat rack, probably took five minutes to go through all of the coats [That has never happened to me, I can usually reach right over and feel the texture of my coat.] So I went downstairs and I remember thinking \"Oh, at least the cab is coming right here for me I don't have to walk a couple blocks to meet it.\" The next thing I knew, I was at the Blind Association and I walked in. I couldn't remember exactly which way to go. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like the school for blind children that I went to as a kid, than the blind association. But I got there and was walking and one of the women who worked there was kind of helping me and she said \"now we turn to the right here\" then she grabbed me and said \"its very narrow here\" she thought I was going to bump into something. Then we ended up in a big open reception area in the front and again I was waiting for this cab. I don't know how I got to the Blind association but she said, I was right next to this big window in the front of the place, she said \"sit here in this prom chair\" and I said \"boy, I bet I'm less nervous today then when I went to the prom.\" Then we started talking about the prom and I said that neither of my kids had ever gone to the prom. I remember going to the bath room and then coming out and they said, \"Your cab was here but he didn't want to wait so he went to have lunch at the restaurant next door and he'll be back to pick you

It was my grandfather's kitchen. He was there and my step-grandmother was there I think, and my mother was over to the left of me talking about cooking breakfast and she said \"well, I'm just afraid to cook on this old stove, I'm afraid that I might do something to it, its so old.\" Then I said \"Maybe I should go into the bedroom and sleep\" and my grandfather said \"well there's no bed in there we never put a bed in there.\" And I said \"well yes there is.\" And he started to get upset and argue with me and I said \"Come on with me and I'll show you there's a bed in there!\" He followed me in and he saw it and just immediately went out of the room and said that his step son must have put the bed in there without his permission and got upset about it. Then we were back in the kitchen and we were sitting there and there was a little boy there, I don't know who it was.

At one point it was definitely Skippy and he kept making comments, making too much noise and I was afraid that we were going to get into trouble. It was the middle of the night and we were out walking. I threatened him that if he did it again that he would be in trouble and he did and so I started beating him. I grabbed him, started slapping him and hitting him as hard as I could, and I just kept it up and kept it up. And I kept asking him to apologize and he wouldn't so I kept beating him. Suddenly I heard him passing gas and he said \"oh, I'm shitting all over myself\" and I thought \"I've gone too far, I've either killed him or done brain damage or something.\" So I stopped and I ran with the other kids, whoever it was with us, and the next thing I knew, we were inside the kid's apartment but the kid was no longer Skippy, but was a kid named KH. We were in the apartment and I remember thinking \"Boy, this place is really sleazy, I don't like it here at all.\" KH wasn't there and we were really worried about what had happened to him. I didn't know if he had died or if the police had picked him up or what happened. Then for some reason I went in to take a shower and the place was really a pit. The tub was small, and instead of being rectangular the way they usually are, it was really high but it was square. It wasn't very big, I remember climbing up to get into it and the tub kind of moved and I thought \"Man, this place just isn't put together very well. I had a hard time getting the curtain closed, and I got shampoo all over my head and the water pressure was so minimal, I could hardly rinse out the shampoo or get my head washed. I was in a hurry and this KH's dad, who I remember as a kid as a real pervert came in and was talking to me and I thought \"This guy's going to rape me or something, I've got to get out of here.\" And he said something like \"there's water coming out, you better turn the shower off.\" And I did, I got out and the next thing I knew, I was outside walking with my son and we had a summons that we had to appear in court that afternoon. I'm not sure what it was for, it had something to do with this incident from the night before I think. It was on really slimy paper, slimy and greasy, like it had Crisco or something all over it. I remember running it under some water and thinking I hope I don't ruin the paper, but I have to get some of this slime off here so I can read it and I had somebody trying to read it for me and that's

My brother in law Moe, who doesn't live with his wife anymore, in fact lives in another town, was there and he was directing me, telling me where to put my feet without trampling the hedges to get the garbage cans out of there and I ended up spilling all of the garbage out of the full one and I knew that I would have to ask him to help me pick up the garbage.", "children": [{"name": "garbage", "size": 5, "children": []}, {"name": "wife", "size": 3, "children": []}, {"name": "ended", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "house", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "cans", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "yard", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "hedges", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "anymore", "size": 2, "children": []}, {"name": "brother", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "months", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "spilling", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "empty", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "heavy", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "lives", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "find", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "belong", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "town", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "feel", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "couldnt", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "fact", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "back", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "2", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "full", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "bunch", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "flower", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "put", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "knew", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "strange", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "doesnt", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "directing", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "thing", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "6", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "trampling", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "telling", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "separated", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "pick", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "fairly", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "live", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "in-laws", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "Moe", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "feet", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "law", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "uncomfortable", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "lot", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "retrieve", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "beds", "size": 1, "children": []}, {"name": "remember", "size": 1, "children": []}], "polarite": -1}, {"name": "60", "size": 176, "dream": "I was in a dorm room at college and was just getting my stuff unpacked and then this other guy appeared, just appeared and there were 3 people in the room instead of 2.
